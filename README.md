# Getting started with PyQuil

This repo contains some demo notebooks for getting started with PyQuil.

## Installation

The easiest way to launch these notebooks is to use [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/guenp/pyquil-getting-started/master).

Otherwise, use the environment.yml file to create a virtual environment using Anaconda in which to start a jupyter notebook server.
